- **ImageService**: Photo upload, compression, and Cloudinary integration with fallback mechanisms
- **SyncService**: Offline queue management, retry logic, and background sync operations
- **StorageService**: Local persistence for form data and offline operation support
- **UserSessionService**: Contribution tracking and user session management

**Duplicate Detection Logic:**

- Use LocationService proximity search within 50-100m radius of new café location
- CafeService provides searchByLocation method with radius parameter
- Implement smart matching considering name similarity and exact coordinates

### **Component Architecture Requirements** [Source: architecture/components.md#core-component-architecture]

**Multi-Step Form Structure:**

- AddCafeFlow container component managing step navigation and form state
- BasicInfoStep, WorkCriteriaStep, PhotoUploadStep as individual step components
- ProgressIndicator showing current step and completion progress
- TouchTarget components with 44px minimum touch areas for all interactive elements
- BottomSheet pattern for full-screen mobile-first form experience

**Form Navigation Patterns:**

- Bottom action bar with next/back/submit buttons using TouchTarget components
- Swipe gesture support for natural mobile step navigation between form screens
- Progressive disclosure with step validation before advancing
- Form state persistence across navigation events

### **Data Models and Validation** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#core-entities]

**Café Entity Structure for Form:**

```typescript
interface NewCafeSubmission {
  name: string // Required, min 2 chars, validated by ValidationService
  location: {
    address: string // Human-readable address
    coordinates: { lat: number; lng: number } // GPS coordinates from LocationService
    city: string // Indonesian city selection
    district?: string // Optional district
  }
  workMetrics: {
    wifiSpeed: 'slow' | 'medium' | 'fast' | 'fiber'
    comfortRating: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
    noiseLevel: 'quiet' | 'moderate' | 'lively'
    amenities: Array<'24/7' | 'power' | 'ac' | 'lighting' | 'food'>
  }
  operatingHours: {
    [key in DayOfWeek]: {
      open: string // HH:MM format
      close: string // HH:MM format
      is24Hours: boolean
    }
  }
  images: Array<{
    file: File // For upload processing
    preview: string // Local preview URL
  }>
}
```

**Validation Requirements:**

- All fields validated using existing Zod schemas in ValidationService
- Real-time validation feedback during form completion
- Address validation through LocationService geocoding
- Image validation for size, format, and compression requirements

### **Core Workflows Integration** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#cafe-contribution-workflow]

**Café Addition Workflow Implementation:**

1. **Add Café Trigger**: Bottom nav "Add" button, empty state CTA, search "not found" fallback
2. **Multi-Step Form (3 Steps)**:
   - Step 1: Basic Info (name, location, hours) with GPS auto-detection and map pin adjustment
   - Step 2: Work Criteria (WiFi speed test/manual, comfort rating 1-5 stars, noise level, amenities
     checklist)
   - Step 3: Photos & Submit (camera + gallery access, auto-compression WebP, community guidelines)
3. **Data Processing**: Client-side validation, optimistic UI update, background sync queue, Google
   Sheets append
4. **Community Integration**: Success feedback, navigate to new café detail, update personal
   contribution stats

### **Mobile Performance and Indonesian Network Optimization** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Form Performance Requirements:**

- Lightweight form assets optimized for 3G/4G network conditions in Indonesia
- Progressive form loading with skeleton states for slower connections
- Image compression using browser Canvas API with WebP conversion
- Form state persistence prevents data loss during network interruptions
- Efficient validation with debounced input to reduce unnecessary processing

**Indonesian Mobile Optimization:**

- Touch-optimized form interactions with proper haptic feedback support
- Network-adaptive image uploading based on connection quality detection
- Offline-capable form submission with background sync when connection restored
- Data usage awareness with image compression targets under 500KB per photo
- Cultural considerations in form labels and help text (clear iconography, minimal text)
