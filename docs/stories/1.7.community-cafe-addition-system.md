# Story 1.7: Community Café Addition System

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** remote worker who discovers great work spaces,  
**I want** to add new cafés to the platform with duplicate prevention,  
**so that** I can contribute unique value to the community efficiently.

## Dev Notes

### **Previous Story Insights**

User onboarding system is fully operational with comprehensive service layer integration and mobile
optimization. Gallery display provides effective café discovery, and users understand the platform
value. The next logical step is enabling community contributions to build content and user
engagement.

### **Service Layer Integration** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#google-sheets-service-layer]

**Available Services for Café Addition:**

- **CafeService**: Complete CRUD operations with caching, validation, and Google Sheets integration
- **LocationService**: GPS integration, geolocation utilities, and proximity-based duplicate
  detection
- **ValidationService**: Comprehensive data validation using Zod schemas for café data quality
- **ImageService**: Photo upload, compression, and Cloudinary integration with fallback mechanisms
- **SyncService**: Offline queue management, retry logic, and background sync operations
- **StorageService**: Local persistence for form data and offline operation support
- **UserSessionService**: Contribution tracking and user session management

**Duplicate Detection Logic:**

- Use LocationService proximity search within 50-100m radius of new café location
- CafeService provides searchByLocation method with radius parameter
- Implement smart matching considering name similarity and exact coordinates

### **Component Architecture Requirements** [Source: architecture/components.md#core-component-architecture]

**Multi-Step Form Structure:**

- AddCafeFlow container component managing step navigation and form state
- BasicInfoStep, WorkCriteriaStep, PhotoUploadStep as individual step components
- ProgressIndicator showing current step and completion progress
- TouchTarget components with 44px minimum touch areas for all interactive elements
- BottomSheet pattern for full-screen mobile-first form experience

**Form Navigation Patterns:**

- Bottom action bar with next/back/submit buttons using TouchTarget components
- Swipe gesture support for natural mobile step navigation between form screens
- Progressive disclosure with step validation before advancing
- Form state persistence across navigation events

### **Data Models and Validation** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#core-entities]

**Café Entity Structure for Form:**

```typescript
interface NewCafeSubmission {
  name: string // Required, min 2 chars, validated by ValidationService
  location: {
    address: string // Human-readable address
    coordinates: { lat: number; lng: number } // GPS coordinates from LocationService
    city: string // Indonesian city selection
    district?: string // Optional district
  }
  workMetrics: {
    wifiSpeed: 'slow' | 'medium' | 'fast' | 'fiber'
    comfortRating: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
    noiseLevel: 'quiet' | 'moderate' | 'lively'
    amenities: Array<'24/7' | 'power' | 'ac' | 'lighting' | 'food'>
  }
  operatingHours: {
    [key in DayOfWeek]: {
      open: string // HH:MM format
      close: string // HH:MM format
      is24Hours: boolean
    }
  }
  images: Array<{
    file: File // For upload processing
    preview: string // Local preview URL
  }>
}
```

**Validation Requirements:**

- All fields validated using existing Zod schemas in ValidationService
- Real-time validation feedback during form completion
- Address validation through LocationService geocoding
- Image validation for size, format, and compression requirements

### **File Locations and Project Structure** [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]

**Component Locations (following established patterns):**

- `src/components/forms/AddCafeForm.tsx` - Multi-step café addition form container
- `src/components/forms/BasicInfoStep.tsx` - Name, location, and hours collection
- `src/components/forms/WorkCriteriaStep.tsx` - Work-specific ratings and amenities
- `src/components/forms/PhotoUploadStep.tsx` - Image capture and upload management
- `src/components/forms/DuplicateWarning.tsx` - Duplicate café detection and resolution
- `src/components/forms/index.ts` - Form component exports

**UI Base Components to Use:**

- `src/components/ui/TouchTarget.tsx` - For 44px minimum touch targets
- `src/components/ui/ProgressiveImage.tsx` - For photo preview and management
- Existing form validation patterns from ValidationService integration

**Page Integration:**

- Add café form accessible from `src/pages/AddCafe.tsx` route
- Integration with existing bottom navigation in `src/components/navigation/BottomNavigation.tsx`
- Success flow navigation back to café gallery with new café highlighted

### **Core Workflows Integration** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#cafe-contribution-workflow]

**Café Addition Workflow Implementation:**

1. **Add Café Trigger**: Bottom nav "Add" button, empty state CTA, search "not found" fallback
2. **Multi-Step Form (3 Steps)**:
   - Step 1: Basic Info (name, location, hours) with GPS auto-detection and map pin adjustment
   - Step 2: Work Criteria (WiFi speed test/manual, comfort rating 1-5 stars, noise level, amenities
     checklist)
   - Step 3: Photos & Submit (camera + gallery access, auto-compression WebP, community guidelines)
3. **Data Processing**: Client-side validation, optimistic UI update, background sync queue, Google
   Sheets append
4. **Community Integration**: Success feedback, navigate to new café detail, update personal
   contribution stats

### **Mobile Performance and Indonesian Network Optimization** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Form Performance Requirements:**

- Lightweight form assets optimized for 3G/4G network conditions in Indonesia
- Progressive form loading with skeleton states for slower connections
- Image compression using browser Canvas API with WebP conversion
- Form state persistence prevents data loss during network interruptions
- Efficient validation with debounced input to reduce unnecessary processing

**Indonesian Mobile Optimization:**

- Touch-optimized form interactions with proper haptic feedback support
- Network-adaptive image uploading based on connection quality detection
- Offline-capable form submission with background sync when connection restored
- Data usage awareness with image compression targets under 500KB per photo
- Cultural considerations in form labels and help text (clear iconography, minimal text)
