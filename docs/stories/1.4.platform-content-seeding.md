## Dev Notes

### **Previous Story Insights**

Complete service layer is now available with comprehensive services including CafeService,
LocationService, ImageService, ValidationService, etc. Service layer includes 90%+ test coverage
with proper TypeScript implementation, ServiceRegistry pattern for dependency injection, and all
services ready for consumption.

### **Service Layer Integration Requirements** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#google-sheets-service-layer]

**Content Seeding Must Use Service Layer:**

- All café additions must use `CafeService.addCafe()` method from established service layer
- Data validation through `ValidationService` using Zod schemas before insertion
- Image processing through `ImageService` for photo optimization and compression
- Location data processing through `LocationService` for Indonesian city support
- Offline queue management through `SyncService` for reliable data insertion

**Service Integration Pattern:**

- Import services from `src/services/index.ts` service registry
- Use `ServiceRegistry` dependency injection pattern for service access
- Follow established error handling patterns with proper fallbacks
- Respect Google Sheets API rate limiting (300 requests/minute)

### **Data Models and Content Structure** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#core-entities]

**Café Entity Requirements for Seeding:**

- `id`: UUID generated client-side for each café
- `name`: Required, minimum 2 characters, Indonesian café names
- `location`: Complete address with GPS coordinates, Indonesian cities and districts
- `workMetrics`: Full work criteria (wifiSpeed, comfortRating 1-5, noiseLevel, amenities array)
- `operatingHours`: Day-specific open/close times with Indonesian business patterns
- `images`: Array with url, thumbnailUrl, uploadedBy, uploadedAt (placeholder data acceptable)
- `community`: loveCount, lastUpdated, contributorId, verificationStatus set to 'verified'

**Indonesian Location Requirements:**

- Focus on major cities: Jakarta, Bali (Denpasar, Ubud, Canggu), with specific districts
- Include GPS coordinates for actual café locations or realistic area coordinates
- Support for Indonesian address formats and city/district naming conventions

### **Content Standards and Quality Requirements** [Source: epic-details.md#story-14-platform-content-seeding]

**Content Quality Standards:**

- Each café must demonstrate proper work-specific rating methodology
- Include realistic WiFi speeds appropriate for Indonesian infrastructure
- Comfort ratings with clear examples of criteria (1-5 scale with reasoning)
- Noise level categories (quiet/moderate/lively) with context
- Amenities relevant to remote work (24/7, power outlets, AC, lighting, food availability)
- Operating hours reflecting actual Indonesian café business patterns

**Geographic Distribution Requirements:**

- Jakarta: Cover major business districts (SCBD, Kemang, Menteng, Senopati)
- Bali: Include Denpasar (business areas), Ubud (creative/co-working), Canggu (digital nomad areas)
- Ensure representation of different café types (traditional, modern, co-working friendly)

### **Database Schema Integration** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#google-sheets-structure]

**Google Sheets Integration:**

- Content will be inserted into "Cafes" sheet following exact column schema (A=id through
  R=updated_at)
- Data transformation through established `transformCafeToSheetRow()` method
- JSON serialization for complex fields (amenities, operating_hours, images)
- ISO date formatting for timestamp fields (created_at, updated_at)

**IndexedDB Caching:**

- Seeded content will populate IndexedDB cache through CacheService
- Cache indexes on city, updated_at, love_count for efficient filtering
- TTL management with 1-hour cache expiration and refresh patterns

### **File Locations and Structure** [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]

**Seeding Script Location:**

- Create `scripts/seed-data.js` as specified in project structure
- Import services from `src/services/index.ts` for service layer integration
- Follow established patterns from `scripts/validate-setup.js` for consistency
- Include progress reporting and error handling appropriate for administrative scripts

**Supporting Files:**

- `scripts/validate-setup.js` - Reference for service connectivity patterns
- `src/services/cafeService.ts` - Main service for café data operations
- `src/services/validationService.ts` - Data validation before insertion
- `src/types/cafe.ts` - TypeScript definitions for data structure compliance

### **Performance and Mobile Optimization Requirements**

**Cache Warming Strategy:**

- Pre-populate IndexedDB cache with seeded content for instant first-load
- Optimize image loading with compressed thumbnails and WebP conversion
- Implement intelligent cache TTL management for content freshness
- Background sync queue initialization with seeded content

**Mobile Performance Targets:**

- Sub-2s load time for gallery display with seeded content
- Optimized for Indonesian mobile network conditions (3G/4G)
- Batch processing with concurrency limits to prevent memory issues
- Progressive loading patterns for images and detailed content

## Testing

**Testing Requirements for Story 1.4** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]:

- **Unit Tests**: Test seeding script functions with comprehensive mocks and validation
- **Integration Tests**: Test service layer integration and data flow to Google Sheets
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark loading times with full seeded dataset on mobile
- **File Locations**: `tests/scripts/unit/`, `tests/scripts/integration/`,
  `tests/scripts/performance/`
- **Frameworks**: Vitest for unit/integration testing with service layer mocks
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ for seeding script logic and error handling
- **Service Testing**: Mock Google Sheets API, IndexedDB, and network conditions
- **Content Validation**: Test data quality, validation rules, and content standards compliance

**Specific Test Cases Required:**

- Seeding script execution with various network conditions
- Data validation and error handling for invalid content
- Service layer integration and proper method usage
- Cache warming effectiveness and performance impact
- Geographic distribution verification and content quality standards
- Rollback functionality and failure recovery mechanisms
