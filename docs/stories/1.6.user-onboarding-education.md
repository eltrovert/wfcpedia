## Dev Notes

### **Previous Story Insights**

Gallery display is now fully functional with comprehensive service layer integration,
mobile-optimized responsive design, and accessibility compliance. All services (CafeService,
LocationService, PreferencesService, UserSessionService) are available with 90%+ test coverage.
Gallery includes location-based filtering, progressive image loading, and offline capabilities. User
can now discover cafés effectively - the next logical step is educating new users on how to properly
evaluate and contribute to the platform.
