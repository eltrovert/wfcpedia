## Dev Notes

### **Previous Story Insights**

Platform now has comprehensive service layer available with CafeService, LocationService,
ImageService, ValidationService, CacheService, and all supporting services with 90%+ test coverage.
Service layer includes ServiceRegistry pattern for dependency injection. Content seeding is complete
with 15 verified cafés across Jakarta and Bali regions, providing immediate data for gallery display
testing.

### **Component Architecture Requirements** [Source: architecture/components.md#core-component-architecture]

**Gallery Component Structure:**

- CafeGallery component with InfiniteScroll and PullToRefresh integration
- CafeCard component with 16:9 aspect ratio and overlay information display
- TouchTarget base component with 44px minimum touch areas for mobile optimization
- Grid layout using single column for mobile-first approach
- ProgressiveImage component for lazy loading with thumbnail fallbacks

**Mobile-First Design Patterns:**

- Bottom navigation with fixed positioning and 60px height
- Touch-optimized buttons with minimum 44px targets
- Backdrop blur effects for overlay controls
- Native-like pull-to-refresh with physics-based animations
- Infinite scroll with performance monitoring

### **Frontend Architecture Integration** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-hierarchy]

**App Structure Integration:**

- Home route component structure: Header (Location + Search) + FilterBar + CafeGallery +
  FloatingAddButton
- Gallery integrates with BottomNavigation component for route navigation
- State management through Zustand stores (userStore, uiStore) and React Query
- Service integration through QueryProvider with offline-first configuration

**State Management Pattern:**

- Use useUserStore for location preferences and visit history
- Use useUIStore for current location, network status, and active filters
- React Query with infinite query pattern for café data fetching
- Optimistic updates for user interactions (love button, sharing)

### **Data Models and Service Integration** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#core-entities]

**Café Entity Display Requirements:**

- Display café name, location (district + city), work metrics prominently
- Show work metrics: wifiSpeed, comfortRating (1-5 stars), noiseLevel
- Display amenities as icon chips (24/7, power, ac, lighting, food)
- Show community metrics: loveCount and verificationStatus
- Display primary image with thumbnailUrl for progressive loading

**Service Layer Integration:**

- Use CafeService.getCafes() with pagination for infinite scroll
- Integrate LocationService for GPS coordinates and city detection
- Use CacheService for offline-first data access with 1-hour TTL
- Implement SyncService for background data updates

### **Mobile Performance and Indonesian Network Optimization** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
