### **Project Structure Requirements** [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]

- Root project structure must include: `public/`, `src/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `tests/`
- Source structure: `components/`, `pages/`, `hooks/`, `services/`, `stores/`, `utils/`, `types/`,
  `styles/`
- Testing structure: `__mocks__/`, `setup/`, `services/`, `components/`, `accessibility/`,
  `mobile/`, `e2e/`
- Configuration files: `.env.example`, `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.js`,

- **ALWAYS implement offline-first patterns** with network fallbacks
- **ALWAYS optimize for mobile performance** with pagination, lazy loading
- **ALWAYS implement proper loading states** with skeletons and error states
- **ALWAYS implement accessibility** with ARIA labels, 44px touch targets

### **Testing Strategy Requirements** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Testing Pyramid**: 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, 10% E2E tests
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest with comprehensive mocks and test utilities

- Performance budgets enforced through build tools
- Mobile viewport testing mandatory for all E2E tests
- Network condition adaptation for Indonesian mobile networks

### Testing

**Testing Requirements for Story 1.1:**

- **Unit Tests**: Test configuration utilities and setup validation
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete development environment setup
- **E2E Tests**: Test mobile viewport development server functionality
