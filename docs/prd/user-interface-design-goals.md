# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

WFC-Pedia prioritizes **functional simplicity over visual polish** to maximize community engagement
within budget constraints. The experience should feel like a community-owned bulletin board rather
than a corporate platform—authentic, unpretentious, and focused on practical work-friendly
information that remote workers actually need.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Gallery-first discovery:** Visual café cards with work-specific data at-a-glance (wifi strength
  icons, comfort ratings, outlet availability)
- **One-tap engagement:** Immediate love/thumbs-up without complex registration flows
- **Progressive disclosure:** Essential info visible, detailed reviews/comments on tap
- **Community storytelling:** WFC Journal as personal workspace narrative, not just data tracking
- **Swipe-based café comparison** instead of desktop-style tables
- **One-thumb navigation** with bottom navigation bar
- **Pull-to-refresh** for real-time status updates
- **Progressive photo loading** for bandwidth optimization
- **Offline-first design** with cached content availability

## Core Screens and Views

1. **Gallery Discovery Screen** - Primary café browsing with location-based results
2. **Advanced Filter Screen** - Detailed work-criteria filtering with location selector
3. **Café Comparison Screen** - Side-by-side view for 2-3 selected cafés
4. **Café Detail Page** - Work-specific criteria, community reviews, photos
5. **Check-in Screen** - Arrival confirmation and session start
6. **Live Session Tracker** - Real-time condition updates during work
7. **Quick Rate Widget** - Streamlined post-session contribution
8. **Add Café Form** - Full café submission for community content creation
9. **WFC Journal Dashboard** - Personal café history and achievement tracking
10. **Community Feed Screen** - Recent user contributions and discoveries
11. **Community Profile** - User contributions and social recognition
12. **Onboarding Flow** - First-time user education on work-specific ratings

## Branding

**Constraint-driven authenticity:** Embrace the ultra-lean aesthetic as differentiator. Clean,
functional design that signals community ownership over corporate polish. Think "Wikipedia
reliability" meets "local café community board."

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Mobile-first responsive web app optimized for Indonesian smartphone usage patterns. Priority on
Android compatibility and lower-bandwidth networks.
