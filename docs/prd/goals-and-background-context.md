# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Create a community-owned platform that helps Indonesian remote workers discover work-friendly
  caf√©s efficiently
- Reduce time waste (currently 30-60 minutes daily) in finding suitable work environments through
  work-specific intelligence
- Establish active user community of 500+ monthly users across 5+ Indonesian cities within 6 months
- Achieve sustainable operations within ultra-lean $10/month budget constraint
- Build foundation for regional expansion to Southeast Asian markets

## Background Context

Indonesian remote workers face a critical gap in discovering work-friendly environments, with 40
million global digital nomads and Indonesia capturing 2% of visits. Current tools like Google Maps
and Foursquare lack work-specific criteria such as internet speed, power outlets, comfort for
extended sessions, and 24/7 availability for global timezone compatibility.

WFC-Pedia addresses this through a community-driven platform that transforms users into content
creators and co-owners, leveraging constraint-based innovation to turn a $10/month budget into a
competitive advantage against venture-funded competitors focused on investor returns rather than
authentic community building.
