4. **Google Sheets backend** - $0/month data storage & management
5. **Simple display interface** - Connect to free hosting platforms

**Engagement Psychology:** 6. **Love/thumbs-up system** - Instant gratification for contributors 7.
**Comments for discussion** - Community validation and improvement 8. **Social media integration** -
Cross-platform reputation building 9. **Accuracy feedback loop** - Quality control through social
proof

**Key Insights:**

- Users must become unpaid data collectors through psychological rewards
- Community validation drives content quality better than moderation
- Personal tracking (WFC Journal) creates daily engagement habit

### 3. Assumption Reversal (10 minutes)

event hosting** - Good ratings earn platform promotion 5. **Partnership discount program** - Direct
customer acquisition tool 6. **Member benefits ecosystem** - Loyalty loop connecting users & owners

**Reversal 3: "Simplicity as competitive advantage" instead of "Feature complexity"** 7. **Static
self-generated data** - No API dependencies or costs 8. **Laser focus on WFC-specific criteria** -
Beat Google Maps at specialized game 9. **Minimal animations** - Speed and usability over
flashiness 10. **UX optimized for comfort discovery** - Solve exact problem, nothing else

**Key Insights:**

- Proactive discovery reduces friction better than advanced search
- Café owner investment creates sustainable growth partnerships
- Intentional simplicity can outperform feature-rich competitors
