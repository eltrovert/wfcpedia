# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for WFC-Pedia, a community-owned platform
specifically designed for Indonesian remote workers to discover and share work-friendly caf√©s. The
architecture prioritizes mobile-first responsive design, static hosting constraints, and Google
Sheets as the backend data source, reflecting the ultra-lean, constraint-driven authenticity that
defines this project.

## Key Architectural Philosophy

- **Mobile-First Progressive Web App**: Designed for Indonesian mobile users with network
  constraints
- **Constraint-Driven Authenticity**: Embracing limitations to create focused, community-centric
  solutions
- **Zero-Cost Operations**: Strategic use of free-tier services for sustainable community ownership
- **Wikipedia-Like Reliability**: Community-driven content with transparent, accessible
  infrastructure
- **Implementation-Ready Design**: Every component specified for immediate development handoff

## Critical Design Decisions (Post-PO Review)

- **Google Sheets Backend**: Enables community transparency and zero operational costs
- **Static Hosting Only**: Simplifies deployment while maintaining excellent performance
- **Offline-First Architecture**: Essential for Indonesian network conditions
- **Touch-Optimized Interface**: 44px minimum targets, one-thumb operation patterns
- **Infrastructure-First Development**: All external services configured before feature development
- **Quality-First Implementation**: Testing and CI/CD established before coding begins
